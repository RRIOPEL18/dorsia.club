        <p class="push-0 pad-t-2 wrapper gutter-1-2">Society has reached a point where money has become the most essential resource. Money has become the defining measure of success, opportunity, status, credibility, and – in most instances – happiness. So why is money not the central topic of education in high school? Why is the average person so terribly financially illiterate?</p>
        <p class="pad-t-1-2 wrapper gutter-1-2 push-0">A country with stable monetary policy will have a fixed amount of money. Consider a country with 100 million people, 10 billion dollars in circulation, and equal wealth distribution. Every member of that population would have $100. The only way for someone to become worth more than $100 is for someone else to become worth less than $100. The only way to accumulate wealth is to take it away from somebody else.</p>
        <p class="pad-t-1-2 wrapper gutter-1-2 push-0">The only way to accumulate wealth is to take it away from somebody else. This is an incredibly important realization. Every dollar you spend is making yourself less wealthy, and somebody else wealthier. The people who understand this principle are far more prepared to be financially successful.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 class="push-0 pad-t-2 text-center"><strong>II</strong></h3>
        <p class="push-0 pad-t-2 wrapper gutter-1-2">There are two types of people: wealth dispersers and wealth accumulators. Wealth dispersers spend more than they make, and thus enrich other people while impoverishing themselves. Wealth accumulators spend less than they make. This is the golden rule of financial education. Spend less than you make. If every person in society took steps towards being a wealth accumulator, this would be the most direct path to financial equality.</p>
        <p class="pad-t-1-2 wrapper gutter-1-2 push-0">It is clearly true that for a significant portion of the population it is nearly impossible to be a wealth accumulator, due to the cost of food and shelter relative to the number of well-paying jobs. But there are still improvements every person on the planet can make, regardless of their position.</p>
        <p class="pad-t-1-2 wrapper gutter-1-2 push-0">The most detrimental wealth dispersing activities are those which have high cost and provide limited benefit. The most pervasive and obvious example is habitual cigarette smoking. Cigarettes, like everything else, can be useful in moderation for stress relief or social engagement. But habitual cigarette smoking causes massive wealth dispersal directly from the poor to the rich. Every time someone purchases a pack of cigarettes, that individual is giving their wealth to the owners of the cigarette companies, and then will inevitably have to distribute more money in healthcare costs. If every habitual smoker stopped buying cigarettes, this would be a huge step towards wealth equality.</p>
        <p class="pad-t-1-2 wrapper gutter-1-2">But nobody wants to cut things out of their lifestyle. Cigarette smokers often do not want to stop smoking. So, for most people the path to wealth accumulation is not to spend less, but to earn more.</p>

        <h3 class="push-0 pad-t-2 text-center"><strong>III</strong></h3>
        <p class="push-0 pad-t-2 wrapper gutter-1-2">There are a few ways an individual can earn more income. The most direct method is to simply work more, which would usually be achieved through a second job. There are mental and physical health implications to this, so for many people this is not a good option. Another method would be to increase your skills, so that you can secure a job with a higher salary. This is typically achieved through work experience or through more education, both of which take years to attain.</p>
        <p class="pad-t-1-2 wrapper gutter-1-2 push-0">A third option would be to start your own business. For people with an entrepreneurial drive this is a great option. But it often requires a lot of money to start a business, and a lot of people do not have the personality to make it work.</p>
        <p class="pad-t-1-2 wrapper gutter-1-2 push-0">The great irony of the stock market is that is one of the major contributors to wealth inequality, but it is also the greatest vehicle for achieving wealth equality. It is accessible to everyone and provides every individual the opportunity to immediately start earning more income.</p>

        <h3 class="push-0 pad-t-2 text-center"><strong>IV</strong></h3>
        <p class="push-0 pad-t-2 wrapper gutter-1-2">Unless someone studies finance in university there are remarkably few accessible and trustworthy ways to become educated about the stock market. People who work in finance perpetrate the mystique that buying stocks is only something that can be done by a sophisticated investor. While there are certain intellectual skills and personality traits that make working in finance more realistic for certain people over others, finance is still far more opaque than it should be. Oftentimes financial concepts are made overly complex, not to make them more accurate, but because doing so will make it more difficult for the average person to understand.</p>
        <p class="pad-t-1-2 wrapper gutter-1-2 push-0">For people who do manage to learn about the stock market, it is still important to emphasize that investing without doing proper research is much more detrimental than not investing at all. But there are a couple simple techniques which can be employed by people of all educations and sophistications which will help ensure investments are reasonably assured to generate a positive return. </p>
        <p class="pad-t-1-2 wrapper gutter-1-2 push-0">Companies that trade on the stock market must publicly report their balance sheet and income statement four times per year. Balance sheets have three sections: assets, liabilities, and equity. Assets are what the company owns, liabilities are what the company owes, and equity is the leftover amount which is attributable to the owners of the company. This leftover amount is usually labelled as “Equity Attributable to Common Shareholders” at the bottom of the balance sheet. This is what the company is worth on the date of the report. A good practice is to compare this to the company’s market capitalization. Market capitalization is the value of the company on the stock market. For example, at the time of writing this, Walmart has a market cap of $294 billion, and common equity on its most recent balance sheet of $72 billion. This means that Walmart is trading on the stock market for roughly 4 times as much as it is worth on paper.</p>
        <p class="pad-t-1-2 wrapper gutter-1-2 push-0">Looking at the income statement will help add a bit more context. Walmart had yearly revenue of roughly $510 billion, meaning that customers gave Walmart $510 billion throughout the year. After paying employees, paying suppliers for the goods sold, and all other expenses, Walmart had normalized profit of $10 billion. These numbers help to rationalize the fact that people are paying 4x more for Walmart than it is currently worth. It brings in massive amounts of money and creates $10 billion in profit each year.</p>
        <p class="pad-t-1-2 wrapper gutter-1-2 push-0">The numbers listed above still provide a faint picture as to whether Walmart is a good investment. Is it worth 4x its current value? In order to answer this question, it would require investigation and comparison to other companies. 4x book value is not outrageous, as Walmart is a very reputable company and a relatively safe investment. But it is certainly possible to find reputable companies that trade at only 2x or 3x book value, and these might constitute a better investment opportunity. People who are interested in these numbers should look at the book value, market cap, revenue, and net income of various other companies, and discover the valuations across different industries.</p>
        <p class="pad-t-1-2 wrapper gutter-1-2 push-0">For people who do not wish to undergo any sort of numerical analysis, the most fundamental investment rule goes back to the concept of wealth dispersers and wealth accumulators. Every time you shop at Walmart, you are giving your money to the owners of Walmart. The owners of Walmart are making $10 billion per year thanks to your contribution. So, if you find yourself spending most of your money at Walmart, it is a logical extension for you to own Walmart stock. Pay yourself for shopping there. Distribute your wealth back to yourself. Likewise, if you find yourself shopping at Apple or buying products every day off Amazon, those are the most logical investments for you to make. We have created a system where it is incredibly easy to own the companies that you shop at. Distribute your wealth back to yourself.</p>

        <h3 class="push-0 pad-t-2 text-center"><strong>V</strong></h3>
        <p class="pad-t-2 pad-b-2 wrapper gutter-1-2">Finance is not an easy topic to become educated upon, but the structure of our society is such that those who are not financially savvy are destined to be wealth distributers forever. For people who do want to improve their financial position, there are two ways to become a wealth accumulator: earn more or spend less. The easiest way to earn more is to learn about the companies you shop at, and then become an owner of those companies. If everyone operated in this manner, our society would have a decent shot at achieving wealth equality. This gap will only widen if we continue to live in a world devoid of financial education.</p>
