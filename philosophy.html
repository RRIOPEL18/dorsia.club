        <p class="push-0 pad-t-2 wrapper gutter-1-2">Modern physics recognizes four fundamental forces of nature – gravity, electromagnetism, strong nuclear force, and weak nuclear force. These four forces explain the natural state of the universe and are classed as non-contact forces, meaning that they influence matter without physical contact.</p>
        <p class="pad-t-1-2 wrapper gutter-1-2 push-0">The remainder of motion in the universe is ascribed to contact forces, which influence matter with physical contact. The most common contact force is applied force. An example of this would be kicking a soccer ball. Force is applied to the ball through physical contact, causing it to move. Friction, another contact force, would then slow the ball down as it comes into contact with the ground. Other contact forces include tension, air resistance, and spring force.</p>
        <p class="pad-t-1-2 wrapper gutter-1-2 push-0">Envision a scenario in which a human could simply think about kicking the soccer ball and cause it to move without touching it. Modern physics would currently not have a description of this phenomenon.</p>

        <h3 class="push-0 pad-t-2 text-center"><strong>II</strong></h3>
        <p class="push-0 pad-t-2 wrapper gutter-1-2">The absence of direct examples of consciousness influencing matter has allowed for the avoidance of the possibility that consciousness should be classified as a force. Let us return to the example of kicking the soccer ball. Synapses in the brain connect the neurons in the brain with the neurons in the body, and cause your muscles to move in such a way as to kick the soccer ball. All of this can be described through conventional forces. But the fact remains that this movement would not occur at all if not directed to do so by your consciousness. Your mind indirectly influences matter. Yet the indirect and immeasurable nature of consciousness has thus far prevented it from being defined as a force.</p>
        <p class="pad-t-1-2 wrapper gutter-1-2 push-0">Are there any examples of consciousness having a more direct impact on matter? Perhaps a good starting point would be to look at phenomenon which are not yet fully understood. There are several candidates which fit this description, with evolution as an ostensibly promising starting point. Red Ash <i>[Fraxinus pennsylvanica]</i> is a species of hardwood tree with a wide range throughout North America. While all Red Ash have the same common ancestor, over time Red Ash trees living in different ecosystems have adapted and become better suited to survive in those areas. For example, Red Ash trees growing in Maine drop their leaves in September to prepare for the winter, while Red Ash trees growing in South Carolina will retain their leaves until November due to the warmer temperatures. Even if a Red Ash tree was relocated from Maine to South Carolina, it would still drop its leaves in September. The date at which to drop its leaves has become encoded in the DNA of the tree.</p>
        <p class="pad-t-1-2 wrapper gutter-1-2 push-0">Darwin’s theories of evolution purport that species adapt over time through natural selection, and the most suitable individuals in a population reproduce and pass their favorable characteristics on to their offspring. At some point in the past, both the Red Ash in Maine and the Red Ash in South Carolina shared a common ancestor, meaning that at some point they would have dropped their leaves at the exact same time. But it is much cooler in Maine than South Carolina, so in order for the trees to survive in this environment they had to begin dropping their leaves earlier. If Red Ash trees in Maine held their leaves until November the trees would be more vulnerable to the cold temperatures. There is no doubt natural selection played a role in this, but what triggered the first instance of this change and then encoded it into the DNA of the tree? Could the consciousness of the tree understand that it had to drop its leaves earlier in order to survive, and thus translated this message to its DNA? This would be evidence of consciousness directly influencing matter.</p>

        <p class="push-0 pad-t-2 wrapper gutter-1-2">War is one of the greatest stimulants for innovation, mainly because war is a matter of life and death. Innovate or die. War is strikingly analogous to evolution. Adapt or die. This is why it makes sense to investigate the influence of consciousness on matter in the context of evolution.</p>
        <p class="pad-t-1-2 wrapper gutter-1-2 push-0">Symbiotic relationships are one of the most fascinating examples of evolution. Mutualism is a type of symbiotic relationship in which two species work together to provide benefits to each other. One of the most common examples of mutualism is between <i>Pluvianus aegyptius</i> and <i>Crocodylus niloticus</i> – the Egyptian Plover and the Nile Crocodile. This image is captured frequently in videos and documentaries; the Nile Crocodile opens its mouth, and the Egyptian Plover flies into its mouth and begins cleaning its teeth. At some point in the past this relationship did not exist. But eventually the crocodile realized it needed a dental hygienist and the plover realized it could score an easy meal. Now it is a standard interaction– the knowledge of this relationship has become encoded into the DNA of these two species. This is an incredible phenomenon. Keep in mind that the current view is that matter is only influenced by the forces mentioned at the beginning of this document. But it is impractical to attribute a change deep within the DNA of two different species to gravity or magnetism or to friction or applied force. The most logical explanation would seem to be that when these two species realized this mutualistic relationship, their consciousness encoded it into their DNA so that future generations could continue to benefit.</p>

        <p class="push-0 pad-t-2 wrapper gutter-1-2">Consciousness undoubtedly exerts indirect influence over matter – every action your brain tells your body to perform is evidence. This alone should perhaps be enough to classify consciousness as a force. But the rigor of the scientific community demands a direct and observable example. There are strong indications that consciousness can alter the DNA of an organism, which would be direct influence upon matter at the most fundamental level. This does not mean that people are going to start moving soccer balls with their minds. But if we recognize that consciousness is a force that can influence the physical world at the quantum level, this would have incredible implications. Consider how this might be applied to human health. This theory would create the real possibility that the attitude of a cancer patient could impact their DNA, and thus impact the efficacy of their cancer treatment.</p>
        <p class="pad-t-1-2 wrapper gutter-1-2 pad-b-2">For too long consciousness has been overlooked as something that exists only in our minds and which has no influence on the world around us. It is time to explore other possibilities, and consider the aspects of our lives that the force of consciousness could impact and improve.</p>
